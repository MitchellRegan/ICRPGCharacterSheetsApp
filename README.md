# ICRPG Character Sheets App
A React Native app created for a group of my friends to track their character sheets for the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/212262/INDEX-CARD-RPG-Core-2E">ICRPG tabletop game</a> since there aren't many (if any) mobile apps for this system. It also includes a built-in dice roller (just in case).
