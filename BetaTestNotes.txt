		BETA TEST NOTES AND ERRORS

v0.1.0, Dice Roller and ICRPG Sheet
	X Jesse had crash immediately after pressing "Create character" button for the first sheet. Says that it was before getting back to Home, and just got stuck on a splash screen. Only happened once with the first character
		X Chris also had a crash in the exact same spot when creating his first character
	X Jesse and Chris were frustrated with TextInput fields requiring the confirm button in order to save. Look for setting to save when not focused?
	X Jesse noted that his first character was put at the bottom of the FlatList on the Home page, not the top. Format the height based on number of elements?
	X Jesse and Chris say that newly created characters don't show up on the Home page until the app is rebooted, but deleting them works instantly

v0.1.1, Dice Roller and ICRPG Sheet
	X Dice roller could use d100(?)
	? Text input fields might sometimes cause random crashes
		- Making each key a random call isn't good so maybe have a const var in the component set to rand and each input key increments off the var
		- Possibly fixed since I haven't seen the error after introducing the key increments. Need more tests
	X ICRPGSheetScreen doesn't refresh components when switching from one sheet to another. Components keep all values from previous sheet and will save over the current sheet if edited

v0.1.2, ICRPG Sheet
	X Changing a character name doesn't refresh on the home page until reboot
	X Matt says that the text input field for Notes.js wasn't accepting input
		X textinput needed "onChangeText" but was still using an incorrect version of "onEditDone"
	X Matt says the Notes.js component crashes when pressing the "Add" button after entering text
		X probably also caused by the incorrect version of "onEditDone"

v0.1.3, ICRPG Sheet
	X every time the user clears out the current HP value they get the "You are dying" alert. Needs to be checked onEditDone
	X App desktop icon isn't zoomed correctly. Need to fix
	X Rename Notes.js to ItemList.js
	X Move armor values from Stats to Health
	X Create a component for Effort Values
	X Remove effort values from Stats.js
	X Mastery value not saving? Matt says it always shows 0 when opening a sheet
    X Make sure all stats are returned to ICRPGSheetScreen from the changed components
    X Need text for Equipment and ItemList to let users know they have to tap an item to edit
	X Crash in the Equipment component when attempting to delete an element in the array
    ? Matt ran into a problem where some character sheet updates didn't appear to be saved and then randomly appeared
        ? Happens when editing a value on a sheet, switching to a different sheet, then back to the first. Changed value appears as the version pre-change, but on refresh shows up correctly
	X Matt says that some numeric input fields don't accept negative values. The negative sign is auto-removed (see Current HP input)
	X Some numeric input fields on the character screen can take non-numeric text and become NaN. possibly gets stuck on NaN
    X Editing CON in Stats.js doesn't update HealthAndArmor.js until refresh
        - Possibly part of the issue with not updating?
        - When ICRPGSheetScreen's save function is called, the charData variable isn't being overwritten
        - When it refreshes, the char data from the initial page load is what's being passed in as props which is probably why charHP keeps getting the old value
            - ICRPGSheetScreen.CheckCharacterToDisplay is called after the page refreshes
            - Since the charData variable has been changed, it no longer matches the version passed by props so it's overwritten by props
            X When selecting a sheet in Home screen, save the index in async as its own var
            X Navigate to the sheet screen
            X Have the default sheet data on each screen be the blank one generated by function call
            X When a sheet screen is on focus, retrieve the index of the sheet from async and then use it in the async sheet array to get the data

v0.1.4, ICRPG Sheet
    - Need a variable in the Fonts.js constants file for the font family of each type of sheet (use default for now but can change later)
        - Need to update all of the ICRPG components to use the designated ICRPG font in Fonts.js for easier changes later
    ? Either refreshes and/or saving causes a lag after completing an input field. Causes subsequent inputs to lag, reset, and sometimes crash the app
